tetris clone in jquery

More columns than ancient Greece! More lines than Studio 54!


###The Challenge:
to create a browser-based tetris clone that allows 2 or more users to 
play against others a-la 2 player tetris, where getting 2 or
more lines at once adds to the bottom of your opponents gameboard.

Possibly include a 'taunt' mechanic?


###Controls:
+ Left, Down &amp; Right arrow: Move block
+ Up arrow: Rotate block clockwise
+ Spacebar: Toggle pause/resume

Current version: Includes 1 player mode only with no. lines determing
the fall speed of each block.
